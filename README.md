# WHY?

Because i have to know C/C++

# What you are going to create?

Well, it would be cool if i was able to create the whole messanger, lets see
what it will be.

But i think, i can make a program, that will contain the whole level 1 
of top 100 redteam projects: [[https://github.com/kurogai/100-redteam-projects/tree/master]]

# The plan

level 1:

[0] TCP or UDP server just to receive messages
[1] TCP chat server
[2] UDP chat server
[3] Multi-threaded UDP or TCP char server (main target)
[4] Server for file transfers (i like it)
[5] Caesar Cipher tool (only for beginning stage)
[6] TCP char server -> The messages should be encoded with Caesar Cipher
[7] ROT13 Cipher
[8] UDP Chat server -> The messages should be encoded with ROT13 Cipher
[9] Remote Command Execution (RCE, also main feature, i would like to create a Trojan)
[10] Recreate the Netcat tool (LETS FUCKING GO)
